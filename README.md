Basic CRUD Application Using C# and Windows Forms
Overview
This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using C# with Windows Forms as the user interface. It allows users to manage records in a SQL Server database by performing essential operations such as adding new records, retrieving/displaying records, updating existing records, and deleting records.

Key Features
Create: Add new records to the database through an input form.
Read: Display existing records in a DataGridView.
Update: Modify details of existing records.
Delete: Remove records from the system.

Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: C#
User Interface: Windows Forms (WinForms)
Database: Microsoft SQL Server
IDE: Visual Studio

Project Workflow
1. User Interface (Windows Forms)
Main Form: Contains buttons for Create, Edit, Read, Update, Delete, and Refresh operations, along with a DataGridView to display records.
Add/Edit Form: A separate form to enter or modify record details.
Message Boxes: Used for confirming actions such as deletion or record creation.
2. Database Operations
Create: Add a new record by submitting a form.
Read: Fetch and display records from the database in the DataGridView.
Update: Edit an existing record by selecting it and submitting the modified data.
Delete: Remove a record by selecting it and confirming deletion.

Technical Steps
1. Database Setup
Open the .sql file located in the project folder.
Copy the queries from the .sql file and execute them in your SQL Server database to set up the schema and insert any initial data.
Search for connectionString within the project files using Ctrl+F.
Update the connection string in the code to match your database configuration:
private readonly string connectionString = "Server=<YOUR DATABASE SERVER/SOURCE>;Database=<DATABASENAME>;Trusted_Connection=True;";

Database Schema:

Your database schema should include a table with fields for storing records, such as:

ID (Primary Key, INT)
Name (VARCHAR)
2. Form Design
DataGridView: Displays records fetched from the database.
Textboxes: Input fields for adding/editing records (e.g., FirstName, MiddleName, LastName).
Buttons: Implement buttons for Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Refresh operations.
3. C# Code Implementation
Below is a sample for adding a new record:

try
{
if (MessageBox.Show("Are you sure you want to save this record?", "System Message", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo, MessageBoxIcon.Question) == DialogResult.Yes)
{
SqlConnection cn = new SqlConnection();
cn.ConnectionString = "Data Source=<YOUR DATABASE SERVER/SOURCE>;database=<DATABASENAME>;Integrated Security=True";
SqlCommand cm = new SqlCommand();
cm.Connection = cn;
cn.Open();
cm = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO tblCrud (FirstName, MiddleName, LastName) VALUES (@FirstName, @MiddleName, @LastName)", cn);
cm.Parameters.AddWithValue("@FirstName", txtfirstname.Text);
cm.Parameters.AddWithValue("@MiddleName", txtmiddlename.Text);
cm.Parameters.AddWithValue("@LastName", txtlastname.Text);
cm.ExecuteNonQuery();
cn.Close();
MessageBox.Show("Record has been successfully saved.", "System Message", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information);
Clear();
LoadEmployee();
}
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
MessageBox.Show(ex.Message, "System Message", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo, MessageBoxIcon.Error);
}

4. Event Handling
Implement event handlers for each button (e.g., Create, Edit, Delete, Refresh).
When a button is clicked, the corresponding CRUD operation is executed (e.g., creating a new record or deleting an existing one).
User Flow
When the application is opened, existing records are displayed in the DataGridView.
Users can:Add new records by clicking the Add button and submitting the form.
Edit existing records by selecting a row and clicking the Edit button.
Delete records by selecting a row and confirming the deletion.
Refresh the displayed data to reflect the latest updates from the database.
Challenges and Considerations
Data Validation: Ensure proper validation for input fields (e.g., mandatory fields, correct data types).
Error Handling: Implement error handling for database connection failures, invalid inputs, or SQL execution errors.
Further Enhancements
Search Functionality: Add a search bar to filter records by specific fields.
Paging: Implement paging in the DataGridView if the dataset grows larger.
Sorting and Filtering: Provide sorting and filtering capabilities in the DataGridView for better data handling.
How to Run the Project
Set Up the Database: Configure your SQL Server or SQLite database and execute the SQL script (script.sql) to create the required tables.
Update the Connection String: Open the project files in Visual Studio and update the connection string according to your local database setup.
Build the Project: Open the project (basic_crud_app.csproj) in Visual Studio and build the solution.
Run the Application: Once built, run the application and use the Windows Forms interface to manage records.

Conclusion
This CRUD application demonstrates basic database operations in a C# Windows Forms environment. It provides a foundation for more complex applications by showing how to interact with a database, validate user input, and handle exceptions effectively.
